# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]
### Changed
- Changed config parameter ``semanticsHub`` to ``semanticshub``
- Moved path ``/models/`` from ``semanticshub.modelJsonSchemaEndpoint`` to ``semanticshub.url``
- Updated default values so that IRS can start out of the box without technical errors. Please note that custom configuration is still necessary for IRS to work properly.

### Migration note
Please make sure that you update your URL config for the semantics hub (see "Changed" section). Otherwise, IRS can not pick up the config correctly. Your new URL needs to contain the /model path.

### Changed
- Minio now uses 1Gi of storage by default.
  > When upgrading from a previous version make sure that the minio PVC and pod is created and accessible by the IRS pod. The previous storage default was 500Gi and Kubernetes can not reduce the PVC size automatically.
