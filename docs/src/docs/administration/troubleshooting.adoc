== Proxy support

If you are using an HTTP(S) proxy for outgoing connections, you need to configure the IRS to use it.

----
JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS=-Dhttps.proxyHost=X.X.X.X -Dhttps.proxyPort=XXXX

You might need to specify both `http` and `https` options, dependending on your configuration.

If your proxy is requiring authentication, you can use the `.proxyUser` and `.proxyPassword` properties in addition.
