== Proxy support

If you are using an HTTP(S) proxy for outgoing connections, you need to configure the IRS to use it.

----
JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS=-Dhttps.proxyHost=X.X.X.X -Dhttps.proxyPort=XXXX
----

You might need to specify both `http` and `https` options, dependending on your configuration.

If your proxy is requiring authentication, you can use the `.proxyUser` and `.proxyPassword` properties in addition.

=== Minio

==== Error: "The specified bucket does not exist"

IRS tries to read data from or write to the Minio storage, but no bucket exists. This can happen if Minio is running without a persistent volume and restarts, thus losing all data.
It can also happen if the persistent volume claim is deleted / recreated.

*Proposed solution steps:*

1. Make sure Minio is configured and running correctly.
2. Restart the IRS - this will recreate the missing bucket automatically.
