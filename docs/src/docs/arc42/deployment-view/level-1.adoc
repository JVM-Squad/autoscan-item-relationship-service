== Pod

This is the actual IRS Docker image which runs as a container. The ports are only available internally and can be opened up with the Service.

== Secrets

The secret information (e.g. connection credentials) is stored here and provided to the Pod at runtime.

== Service

The service resource opens up selected ports of the Pod so that other applications in the same cluster can access it or to be used by the Ingress.

== Ingress

The ingress uses a reverse proxy to provide specified Service ports to the internet under a specified URL. This make the IRS API publicly available.
