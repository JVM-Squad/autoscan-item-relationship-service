The Dataspace Discovery Service handles multiple EDC-Urls received for BPN.
This applies to the following scenarios.

==== Scenario 1: One EDC with multiple DTRs

IRS queries all DTRs for the globalAssetId and will take the first result it gets.
If none of the DTRs return a result, IRS will create a tombstone.

....


==== Scenario 2: Multiple EDCs with one DTR

IRS starts a contract negotiation for all registry contract offers in parallel and queries the DTRs for all successful negotiations.
The first registry which responds with a DT will be the one used by IRS.

....



==== Scenario 3: One EDC with one DTR

Only one EDC found for BPN and the catalog only contains one offer for the DTR.
IRS will use this registry and will create a tombstone if no DT could be found for the globalAssetId.

....


==== Scenario 4: Multiple EDCs with multiple DTRs

IRS starts a contract negotiation for all the registry offers.

[plantuml,target=discovery-DTR--multiple-EDCs-with-multiple-DTRs,format=svg]
....
include::discovery-DTR--multiple-EDCs-with-multiple-DTRs.puml[]

....

....



==== Scenario 5: Multiple EDCs with no DTRs

IRS starts a contract negotiation for all the registry offers and creates a tombstone since no DTR could be discovered.

[plantuml,target=discovery-DTR--multiple-EDCs-with-no-DTRs,format=svg]
....
include::discovery-DTR--multiple-EDCs-with-no-DTRs.puml[]

....

==== Special Scenario: Same DT in multiple DTRs

IRS will use all registries to query for the globalAssetId and takes the first result which is returned.
If no DT could be found in any of the DTRs, IRS will create a tombstone.

==== Special Scenario: Multiple DTs (with the same globalAssetId) in one DTR

IRS uses the `/query` endpoint of the DTR to get the DT id based on the globalAssetId.
If more than one id is present for a globalAssetId, IRS will use the first of the list.
