== Authentication / Authorization

=== IRS API

The IRS is secured using OAuth2.0 / Open ID Connect.
Every request to the IRS API requires a valid bearer token.
JWT token should also contain two claims:

- 'bpn' which is equal to the configuration value from `API_ALLOWED_BPN` property
- 'resource_access' with the specific 'Cl20-CX-IRS' key for C-X environments. (The keys are configurable. For more details see chapter "IRS OAuth2 JWT Token").
The list of values will be converted to roles by IRS.
Currently, IRS API handles two roles: **'admin_irs'** and **'view_irs'.** A valid token with the **'admin_irs'** role can access any endpoint exposed by the IRS API, while a token with the **'view_irs'** role does not have access to policies endpoints and can operate only on resources it owns.
That means that he only has access to the resources he has created, e.g. jobs and batches.
This behavior is shown in the table below.

=== IRS OAuth2 JWT Token

IRS expects the JWT access token to have the following structure to be able to extract role information:

[source,json]
----
{
...
  "resource_access": {
    "Cl20-CX-IRS": {
      "roles": [
        "view_irs",
        "admin_irs"
      ]
    }
  },
...
}
----

The field names can be configured via application.yaml:

[source,yaml]
----
# OAuth2 JWT token parse config. This configures the structure IRS expects when parsing the IRS role of an access token.
oauth:
  resourceClaim: "resource_access" # Name of the JWT claim for roles
  irsNamespace: "Cl20-CX-IRS" # Namespace for the IRS roles
  roles: "roles" # Name of the list of roles within the IRS namespace
----

=== IRS as DTR client

The IRS acts as a client for the Digital Twin Registry (DTR), which is also secured using OAuth2.0 / Open ID Connect.
The IRS uses client credentials to authenticate requests to the DTR.
Due to this, the IRS account needs to have access to every item in the DTR, unrelated to the permissions of the account calling the IRS API.

=== IRS as decentralized DTR client

In a decentralized network, IRS uses the EDC client to access the provider DTR.
This way, no authentication, other than the EDC contract negotiation, is needed to access the DTR.

=== IRS as EDC client

The IRS accesses the Catena-X network via the EDC consumer connector.
This component requires authentication via a Verifiable Credential (VC), which is provided to the EDC via the Managed Identity Wallet.

The VC identifies and authenticates the EDC and is used to acquire access permissions for the data transferred via EDC.

Credentials must never be stored in Git!
