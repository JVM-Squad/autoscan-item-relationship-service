== Overview

When a user requests job details, the IRS looks up the jobId in the persistent job store. If the job exists, it will proceed to fetch the job details and prepare a response object.
Only if the job is in state "COMPLETED" or if the caller has set the parameter "includePartialResults" to true, the IRS will fetch the payload data for the job (relationships, AAS shells and submodels, if applicable) and attach it to the response object.

This will then be passed to the caller.
