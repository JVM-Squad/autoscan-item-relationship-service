== Overview

If a job is registered via the IRS API, it will be persisted (with its parameters) in the JobStore, where it can be retrieved by further calls and processes.
Then, the starting item ID is extracted, and a new transfer process is handed to the ExecutorService, which will process it asynchronously (see Scenario 2: Job Execution).

In the meantime, the JobOrchestrator returns a response to the API caller, which contains the UUID of the new job.
This UUID can then be used by the caller to retrieve information about the job via the API.
The input provided by the caller determines how the job will operate (starting point, recursion depth, aspect filter, ...).
